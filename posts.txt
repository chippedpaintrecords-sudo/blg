it pisses me off that weed is still illegal at the federal level...
not just for getting high...

we can use it to make paper, plastic, fabric, oil, fuel, food...
we could run the whole god damn country on weed.
imagine hemp diesel cars, hemp-fired power plants,
everything made from petroleum based plastic could be made
from biodegradable hemp plastic... we could even build houses from the shit.
hempcrete is real... theres too many uses to even list.
